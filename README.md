# wp-plugin-reviews

The goal of this exercise is for you to create a Wordpress plugin which will fetch an array of reviews from an external REST API and display them in a nice list to the user.

The API returns data in JSON format (see attached file for a sample response).

You are free to use any method you prefer to mock the REST API and have your plugin load the data from the mock API with the sample JSON response.
